- New task chains branch from Elizabeth after training. There is an "exploration" chain that takes you to all the various NPCs in Barton to help them with their tasks, and a "defend the town" chain that takes you back into the Sewers on several new quests. Both of these task chains result in nice rewards that include the *choice of a new ring*, so you can really advance your character by doing these tasks early on. NOTE: These tasks are intended for new characters only. They are not intended as "revisit" tasks. If you're already past this point in the life of your character, these new quests will not be available to you.

<br><br>- Several new "teach tasks" are available from NPCs throughout Barton. These are informational and mostly centered around letting new players find out more about the features of the game. Heck...a lot of this stuff was never explained to you, so even you oldbies might benefit from some of these. :)

<br><br>- The down-leveling feature ("suppression") is now available to you. If you want to lower your max ring CL, just go to the Null Chamber and speak with Trixie. She gives you an opportunity to down-level yourself. Just follow her instructions and you'll find that it's easy to do. NOTE: Suppression only "caps" your max ring CL. It does not directly affect your overall CL. Your overall CL is calculated based on the effective CL of all your currently equipped rings, just like normal. It's just that some of your rings may be artificially suppressed after you down-level and that affects your overall CL.

<br><br>- The chat "send" buttons got text added to them to make them more easily understood by new players.

<br><br>- The PDA Map icons were fixed so that active flags now show, even when a "?" icon is available for an NPC. (The active task flag was being hidden in the previous version.)

<br><br>- You can now click and drag the Map around without having to unclick the "Center on Self" button. (To recenter the Map on yourself after dragging it, just click the "Center on Self" button.)

<br><br>- Gustav's repeatable quest should work now.

<br><br>- NOTE: We caught a really bad bug in our database stuff last night. It occasionally caused quest flags and mini-map flags to get restored (incorrectly) after they had been deleted. This *may<br><br>- be the source of why quests were getting "flaky" for some people randomly. Our fingers are crossed that quests will be more stable in the future due to this fix.
