<h2>The "Silent Treatment" Fixes</h2>
We've been strengthening scripts to fix issues that people are having with "silent" NPCs. If you've completed any of these tasks, and then had the NPC involved suddently go "silent" on you, there will be fixes in the next update that will let you continue from where you left off:
- Completed "The Wish Tree" (Katsumi)
<br><br>- Completed "Uncle Kin" (Katsumi)
<br><br>- Completed "Mon Cheri" (Gustav)
<br><br>- Completed "Merit in the Eyes of the Spirits" (Rin and Lin)
<br><br>- There was a case where Arnold could go silent during "Dimming the Lanterns"
<br><br>
<h2>Other Script Fixes</h2>
- Fixed Morgan's "Spear Me No Lies" task so it can complete.
<br><br>- Fixed "Feathers for Blaze" so it updates the task if you choose to not accept this repeatable task again.
<br><br>- The "Returning a Regular" task got script improvements to make its logic more robust.
<br><br>- If you tried to turn in "A Gaian About Town" when it first came out, your data may have gotten glitched and you couldn't turn it in. If that was the case, and you've fulfilled all the favors for Elizabeth's friends, then the next time you talk to Elizabeth, that quest will complete for you. (And you'll get the ring reward.)
<br><br>- The issue with people getting left behind in Sealab after beating the chapter-end boss is fixed and it won't occur any longer.
<br><br>- Uncle Kin's ring reward is fixed. If you finished this task since the last update (when it got broken), then return to Uncle Kin after the next update and he'll reward you with the ring you didn't get.
<br><br>
<h2>No More Aqueduct Kill Stealing</h2>
The new "INTO THE FRAY" task has "kill stealing" issues right now. This will be fixed in the next update to prevent players from getting quite so angry with each other. smile
<br><br>
<h2>Big Framerate Optimization</h2>
The code team found another way to optimize the game significantly. You should be able to feel the difference in the next update!
<br><br>
<h2>Boss Lair Changes</h2>
- A big overhaul of the Stone Coatl Throne Room logic should make this scenario much more entertaining.
<br><br>- Staging areas have been added to the Katsumi's Doll, Wolf Den, and Duneslam Island scenarios so that a Crew can gather inside the scenario before triggering to make it start. Just hang out near where you spawn (you can move around a little), and don't attack anything until you're ready to begin. (The improved Stone Coatl encounter also has a staging area built into it.)
<br><br>- Sealab changes *might* get in for this next update. The logic changes are made, but tuning and a few code changes need to occur before it's ready to go. But changes *are* being made.
<br><br>
<h2>Chest Respawn Fixes</h2>
Bugs were found in the way that some camps were being respawned and this caused some of the chests in the game to break. Those scripts have been fixed now also.
