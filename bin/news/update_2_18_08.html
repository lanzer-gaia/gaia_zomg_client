<h2>Bass'ken Fluff Changes</h2>
The guards recently put out garbage cans along the road leading north. But two funny things occurred at that time:
<br><br>- It turns out that the grass fluffs and carrion fluffs are intimidated by these silent iron sentinels and they now huddle in the bushes and the trees in the area instead of wandering freely.
<br><br>- But when someone beats on one of the cans, that seems to encourage the fluffs to come out of hiding. (Maybe they think the trash can is no longer so threatening or something.)
<br><br>- The trash cans don't seem to intimidate the Mother Fluffs or her guardians at all. If anything, the Mothers have become more protective of the fluffs in the area. Be warned...if you are attacking a fluff...and one of the Mothers sees you doing it...you're in for a world of hurt.

<h2>Trixie's Tips</h2>
When you are Dazed and you choose to go back to the Null Chamber to Awaken, you will now find that Trixie tries to be helpful by giving you hints that might help you survive longer in the future.<br>
<br>
If you don't want to see Trixie's hints, then you can speak to her right there in the Null Chamber and turn it off as a conversation option.<br>
<br>
If you ever want to turn it back on again, you can do that in the same way.

<h2>Other Improvements</h2>
- The "Suppress your CL" conversation with Trixie has been improved so that you only see the tutorial the first time that you access that conversation (after this change). From that point on, Trixie won't force you to read the tutorial and will let you just pull up the Suppression widget instead.
<br><br>- Literally, over 200 minor bug fixes are included in this update (yes...200 more...we've been busy).
<br><br>
<h2>Optimization Fix List</h2>
More artwork was optimized. This week's monsters that were improved for framerate reasons included:
<br>- Sand Castle Golem
<br>- Taiko Drum
<br>- Predator Prairie Pup
<br>- All Kokeshi Dolls (regular, collectible, and Kat's Doll)
