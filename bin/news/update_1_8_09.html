- Training mission fixes (from beginning of the game through Elizabeth's Defend and Explore paths). This is part 1 of the fixes that will be coming in over the next week or so.

<br><br>- Leadership migration now occurs properly within Crews. If your leader quits or goes off-line, then someone else in the Crew will become leader instead.

<br><br>- Removed the Christmas tree, restored the Fountain Game, and moved everthing back to its pre-Christmas position.

<br><br>- Loading times have been reduced when loading into the game. Some players may notice no improvement at all, while others will see more marked improvements.
