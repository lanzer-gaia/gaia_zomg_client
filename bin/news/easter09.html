<h1>"Easter again? Already?!? Nooooooo!"</h1>
You think Santa has it tough? Faugh! He only has to deliver one bunch of presents to each household in the world. The Easter Bunny has to not only visit every home, but he has to hide *every* *stinking* *egg* *himself*.<br>
<br>
It takes forever...and he's tired of it!<br>
<br>
Last year, he took out his annoyance on innocent Gaians by creating ticking easter eggs that exploded in their faces when handled. He and his henchhares have been on the run since then, hiding out to avoid being made into sumptuous hassenfeffers by the angry mob.<br>
<br>
But just because he's hiding doesn't meant that he's off the hook for delivering eggs again this year...and he still hates the job! So this year, he and his posse created...self-replicating, self-ambulatory eggs!<br>
<br>
"By the silvery light of fu Inle, we will venture silf and spread hrair of these simulcra across the world. Thus, in one swell foop, they will cover the world like our hraka! Let the humans silflay for their own eggs wherever they can find them!"**<br>
<br>
Now the egg-things are all over the place, and destroying one explodes the egg, dispersing the nanites from which it is made. Those nanites drift to a new location, quickly assembling themselves into another egg, and moving into a self-selected, partially-hidden location.<br>
<br>
To prevent the henchhares from having to also deliver gifts, the eggs themselves create small prizes inside, sometimes converting the egg yolk into solid gold, and other times constructing tiny little items for you to discover.<br>
<br>
The Barton Town Council is concerned that these eggs might become a hazard, replicating out of control over time, and so they've asked Johnny Gambino to find a way to destroy them once and for all, but until that occurs, the eggs are all over the place!<br>
<br>
So...Happy Easter, from the overly-annoyed, slightly insane, on-the-run, more-than-slightly-lazy Easter Bunny...and his henchhares.<br>
