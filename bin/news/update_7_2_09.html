Random events will occur in various zones now at random times, more in prime time than in off-hours. If you are in the proper zone when it occurs, you will be notified so that you're aware that it's happening. NOTE: This is just the start of the event structure. We'll be adding more and more events...some of them quite large!...in the coming months.<br>
<br>
Instructions and details of the events are supplied to players in the zone when the event begins, but as a teaser for the sort of things you can expect to see, here's a list of the events:<br>
<br>
- Barton Town : Aerial Bombardment! (CL 2.0 and below)<br>
- Village Greens : Rotary Menaces! (CL 2.0 and below)<br>
- Bill's Ranch : Grucken Chuckin'! (CL 3.0 and below)<br>
- Zen Gardens : Deadman Spies! (CL 4.0 and below)<br>
- Bass'ken Lake : BuzzKill! (CL 5.0 and below)<br>
- Old Aqueduct : Bug Breakout! (CL 6.0 and below)<br>
- Gold Beach : Trophy Hunters! (CL 7.0 and below)<br>
- Otami Ruins : Saving the Spirits! (CL 8.0 and below)<br>
<br>
And every zone also has occasional Orb Spills where Charge Orbs begin appearing for a short period of time, available to anyone that can grab them first. Scramble!<br>
<br>
ADDITIONALLY:<br>
<br>
* The Night Patrol (flying giftboxes) in Bass'ken Lake now spawn twice as often, but you must now also suppress to CL 5.0 or lower to fight them.<br>
<br>
* The chapter end-boss encounter has been changed. If everyone in your Crew gets Dazed during the encounter, your unconscious bodies will be moved away from that encounter area. When you recover and return, the fight will begin again from the start. This means that you'll need to fight the tail, body, and head all in one session now. NOTE: Health totals on the EB body parts have been reduced to adjust for the need to do the encounter all in one piece.<br>
<br>
* The logic (AI) of the Robofish have been changed. They are a bit faster than they were previously (so they can catch you) and they now have various ways of reacquiring targets, so the tactic of "run through the tunnel" won't work nearly as well as it used to do.<br>
<br>
* The logic (AI) of monsters in general that have multiple attacks has been improved so they will change between the attacks on occasion and use them more logically. The upshot of this is that you may see a few attacks that weren't getting used very often, and some monsters may feel a bit different in game (like the Predator Prairie Pups). This is the first in a series of improvements to the AI system that will occur over the next couple of months.<br>
<br>
* You must now be CL 7.0 or lower to fight Landshark. Landshark itself is 7.5, and a Boss, so be prepared for a tough fight.<br>
<br>
* Ring Buffer and Double-Orb PowerUp durations have been reduced from 60-minutes to 20-minutes.<br>
<br>
* An exploit has been sealed. When a higher-CL player buffs or heals a lower-CL player, the buff/heal is applied at the CL of the target. This prevents veteran players from reducing the difficulty of encounters to ridiculously easy levels, but still allows them to participate/help without suppressing their CL.<br>
