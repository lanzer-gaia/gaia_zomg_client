<h2>A letter from our new President</h2>
Greetings and Salutations, Gaians!<br>
<br>
We here at the OmniDrink Amalgamated Heavy Manufacturing Concern are extremely pleased to bring you the first in our series of great new areas for you to explore within zOMG!.<br>
<br>
We've done numerous marketing studies and it's become obvious to us that there are two things that players really like to see within a game: 1) Bloody, nasty violence, and 2) Greek mythology.<br>
<br>
Therefore, we've created this new cloud city that combines Aztec *and* Greek mythologies together! It's two, two, two cultures in one!<br>
<br>
So please enjoy our new offering, which we call "Tlauixcalpantecuhtliopolis". The cloud citadel of Tlauixcalpantecuhtliopolis can be found by speaking to Cresento (in Barton Town) and boarding his airship. Once you get to Tlauixcalpantecuhtliopolis, you'll be able to speak to characters there to find new tasks. These Tlauixcalpantecuhtliopolian adventures will result in Tlauixcalpantecuhtliopolian recipes for you to make and wear!<br>
<br>
We hope that you appreciate the new items and area. So come on in and inundate yourself in Tlauixcalpantecuhtliopolic society!<br>
<br>
Sincerely, and warmly,<br>
William F. Drink<br>
President<br>
OmniDrink Amalgamated Heavy Manufacturing Concern<br>
