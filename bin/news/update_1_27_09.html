<h2>PDA Map Improvements</h2>
The PDA Map friend icons are now much more useful. When too many people want to be in a zone at the same time, we have to spin up extra instances of that zone for the overflow. When one of your friends is in another instance of the same zone you're in, it can be confusing to understand on the PDA Map.<br>
<br>
So now, you'll see a new icon start to appear when you have a friend in that situation. To join your friend, it's as easy as clicking on your friend's icon on the PDA Map and warping yourself to his/her instance. (To move your friend to *your* instance instead, you can simply invite him to your Crew. That will do the trick also.)<br>

<h2>Other Improvements</h2>
- Back Alley Bargains got an overhaul to make it more like other shops and easier to understand. (The display case is removed, the starter clothing items are now in other stores, and the PowerUps are now in the main window.
<br><br>- The old Ring Polisher PowerUp that increased all of your currently-equipped ring effects by 150% has been discontinued. It has been replaced with the new Ring Buffer. Whereas the Ring Polisher only lasted three minutes, the Ring Buffer has the same effect, but now lasts ONE HOUR instead. (NOTE: You can still use the old Ring Polishers, but they are no longer offered for sale at Back Alley Bargains.)
<br><br>- We reduced the size of a bunch of our SWF files, so you should see big improvements in loading times, especially if you're using a slower connection speed.
<br><br>- Some artwork optimization work, but mostly just small tests right now. (We have identified ways to fix some assets for good framerate imrpovements though, and more changes are coming soon.)
<br><br>- Big improvements (again) in the guest experience for new users.
<br><br>- New mini-boss lairs (the Saw Mill and Duneslam Island) *may* be available in this update. Check the zOMG! forum announcements to see if those scenarios were passed by QA in time or not. If not this update, they'll be available in the next update.
