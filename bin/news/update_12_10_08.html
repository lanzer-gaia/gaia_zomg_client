- Training (all of it) is completely redone. It's shorter, snappier, lots more pictures, less text, and less prone to breakage. Any players still within the Train, Old Station, or the Sewers will have their quests and flags reset to a newbie state and will be placed at the start of the Train again. For those of you stuck within the Sewers...this is the fix you've been waiting for. (And the "Do a Lap!" quest is gone, gone, gone.)

<br><br>- The Map feature now shows ALL quest givers, so if you're looking for something to do, you can pull up your map and see where to go to get a quest. (Active tasks are still shown with the red flag, whereas potential tasks are shown as a "?" icon.)

<br><br>- The chests have had their Total Charge checks removed. The chests now check overall CL only.
