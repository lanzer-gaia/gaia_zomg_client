- The values in the new "feast or famine" loot mechanism have been adjusted to provide better drop rates.

<br><br>- The Hive has been rebalanced so that the dynamic scaling works better with it now.

<br><br>- The Gauntlet is dynamically scaled (and gameplay changed signficantly from the original, depending on the crew size in the encounter).

<br><br>- The Throne Room is dynamically scaled (and also plays differently).

<br><br>- Three new repeatable quests added to Zen Gardens (Katsumi, Arnold, and Trip).

<br><br>- Katsumi's quest chain has been shuffled around. Her quests are now in the following order: Wish Tree, Uncle Kin, Kat's Doll. This puts the "boss fight" at the end of her chain, which is better gameplay. NOTE: If you are currently doing these quests at the time that we update, your quests will be reset the next time you enter the Shrine room. You might have to redo a quest, but this will prevent you from getting messed-up data from the rearrangement.

<br><br>- Combat regen removed from the chapter-end boss. Health for the arms and body were increased.

<br><br>- New repeatable quest added to Bass'ken Lake (received from Ryan).

<br><br>- There is now a "GO" command. (The "G" key.) When you have a target selected, you can hit "G" to move to where that target was located at the time of the key press. NOTE: This is not a finalized feature, but it *does<br><br>- make it a lot easier to close to within range of a monster if you are using melee rings.

<br><br>- There is now a "/invite" command you use in your Chat Pane that lets you invite people elsewhere on your same world server into your Crew. (Useful when trying to invite folks outside of your zone that don't appear on the crew list.) Format is: /invite <username>

<br><br>- Music volume no longer resets when you zone.

<br><br>- Clan chat works again!

<br><br>- The screen elements have been resized now so that monitor resolutions of 1024x768 can keep chat and PDA open while playing. NOTE: This change results in the save config for your window positions being invalid. So the first time you play after this change, you'll need to reposition your windows the way you like them, but the game will remember those settings from then on.

<br><br>- If you are Dazed, you won't be able to use switches. (Switches are things like chests, the Goof Tee, the sewer valves, etc.)

<br><br>- You shouldn't get any more "?" icon rings that don't function. (Mentioning this because it's annoyed some of you.)

<br><br>- The "/r" (reply) functionality is fixed.

<h2>Game Balance Changes</h2>

<br><br>- Cherry Fluffs have been offensively nerfed a bit.

<br><br>- Rings that do statistic buffs got increased durations under the theory that if the effect lasts longer, more people will be interested in using them. They're a lot more useful now with 2-4 times the duration they used to have.

<br><br>- Defensive abilities also got increased durations so that it's more feasible to have a crewmember buffing crewmates...but still able to do something *else<br><br>- than buffing once in a while.

<br><br>- Exhaustion costs for rings were reduced slightly. Monster healths were increased slightly. Monster damage was reduced slightly. The end result is that combats take a little longer to complete (only a tiny bit longer), but it gives a bit more breathing room to consider other tactics besides smash-smash-smash and it makes crowd control abilities more useful.

<br><br>- Divinity and Healing Halo were improved significantly. Longer durations and better effect.

<br><br>- Loot drop rings (rings found as part of monster loot or in chests), as well as rings granted as quest rewards, are now attuned to the user (cannot be traded or sold).

<br><br>- Rings that were found previous to this change are NOT attuned...but the first time they are equipped by a player, they will become attuned to that player.
