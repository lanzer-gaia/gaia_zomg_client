The lists and notes below were made after the 1/20/09 balance changes and may become obsolete after any future balance changes.

<br><br>However, these notes and lists are designed to give you more information about the usefulness of your rings, especially when taken into consideration with any other special abilities the attack may have (like debuffing dodge or accuracy on a target, causing fear, or knocking an opponent away from you).

<br><br><h2>About "Non-Self" Rings</h2>
Lots of folks don't currently use rings that can't be used on yourself.

BUT...if you Crew a lot...consider them. In every case where a ring is "used on others only", the buffs or effects given are very powerful, more powerful than the rings that *can* be used on yourself. If everyone in your Crew devotes one slot to this type of ring, then you'll find your Crew is much more powerful than without those effects.

That's up to you, of course. But if that sounds interesting to you, give it a try!

(For example: Wish is far more efficient and powerful to a Healer than Bandage or Diagnose (when healing a single target). And Rock Armor can be stacked with Teflon Spray for *very* effective armor totals on your allies.

<br><br><h2>Healing Rings</h2>
- Wish : Does the most immediate healing. Only one target at a time, but it does the entire amount immediately.
<br><br>- Bandage : Does the most healing OVER TIME. If you have a few seconds to spare, this is the most stamina-efficient healing...but you might die before the full effect occurs.
<br><br>- Diagnose : Area effect healing...which is cool...but the least amount of healing per person.

<br><br><h2>Stat Buff Rings</h2>
Just one tip: There are some rings that can only be used on yourself, and some that can be used only on other players. These effects *do* stack. So keep that in mind when Crewing with others.

<br><br><h2>Last Note</h2>
Dont' forget Crowd Control rings!!! To state the obvious: If they aren't attacking you, then they're not hurting you and you can beat the encounter more easily.
