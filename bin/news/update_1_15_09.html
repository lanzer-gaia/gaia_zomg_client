- A "News" page has been added! (This brought to you by the Dept. of Redundancy Department since you're already reading it.)
<br><br>- The Intro movie no longer plays automatically. To view the movie, just click the big "Watch the Movie" button on this page.
<br><br>- New mini-boss lairs have been added! The Katsumi's Kokeshi Doll encounter in Zen Gardens is now an instance, and so is the She Wolf encounter in Bass'ken Lake. <b>You can replay these encounters as many times as you wish!</b> You have to have the quest, or have completed the quest OR someone in your crew has to have, or have completed the quest, in order for you to enter the encounter area. Also, these quests have max CL limits, so you may have to Suppress your CL to play them. (Talk to Trixie in the Null Chamber to temporarily suppress your CL.)
<br><br>- Big improvements were made if you are playing as a "guest". The flow into the game, and the ease of registering are now MUCH better.
<br><br>- Lots of script fixes throughout Barton Town, the Sewers quests, and the training sequence were made.
