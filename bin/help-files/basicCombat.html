<h1>Basic Combat</h1>
<br>
<h2>Selecting a Target</h2>
There are two ways to select a target.<br>
1) You can mouse click on it, or;<br>
2) You can use the '~' or 'Q' keys to cycle through all the targets on your screen, one-at-a-time<br>
<br>
<h2>Using a Ring</h2>
Many rings (not all) require a target before they can be used. So in most cases, the first step is to select a target.<br>
<br>
Once you have a target selected, select the ring you want to use by clicking its icon in the Action Bar at the bottom of your screen. After its recharge timer has expired, click that icon again to use that ring again. To use a different ring on the same target, simply select that other ring and then click its icon to use it.<br>
<br>
There is an alternative method of selecting and using rings that can save you time during combat. These ring shortcuts are the number keys, 1-8. The number '1' corresponds to the left-most ring you have equipped on your Action Bar. Number '8' corresponds to the right-most ring, with everything else in-between.<br>
<br>
To use a shortcut, just press the appropriate number key. This selects the ring and fires it at the same time. These shortcuts save you time, especially if you use the mouse-click method of moving, but are useful even if you are a WASD or arrow-key player.<br>
<br>
<h2>Recharge timers</h2>
Each time you activate a ring, its icon on your Action Bar greys out immediately. A countdown timer then begins to wheel around on the icon, indicating how long it will be until you can use that ring another time. Ring recharge timers are as short as 1 second, and as long as several minutes. The amount of time to recharge is completely dependent on the ring.<br>
<br>
<h2>Stamina and Kneeling</h2>
The process of activating a ring drains a bit of your energy each time that you do it. How much energy (Stamina) is drained from you is dependent on the type of ring being used.<br>
<br>
When you are reduced to zero Stamina, you can no longer power your rings. Thus, you'll have to either rest to regain Stamina, or utilize some alternative energy-replenishing method, like a Supercharger PowerUp, or the ring effect, Divinity.<br>
<br>
You can always Kneel to recover Stamina (and Health) more quickly. This is done by clicking the Pose button your Action Bar. Click it once to Kneel, and then click it again to Stand. WARNING: While you are Kneeling, you restore Stamina and Health more rapidly but you are extremely vulnerable to attack. You will suffer three times as much damage while Kneeling...so choose your resting spots carefully.<br>
<br>
<h2>Need more Power?</h2>
Do you feel like your rings are underpowered? If so, there are two things to consider:<br>
<br>
- Have you charged your rings up recently? If you have spare Charge Orbs sitting in your inventory unused, you might consider visiting the Null Chamber and putting them into your rings instead! It makes a big difference!<br>
<br>
- Have you considered using PowerUps? If not, take a second and check out this info: <a href="event:help:powerUps.html">PowerUps</a><br>
<br>
<h2>Some Easy Ring Tips</h2>
Below are a few general tips to consider that might help you survive a bit longer in combat.
- Damage is great and melee damage is the strongest damage...BUT...defenses are critical in this game and can make a huge difference to how fast you and your Crew are destroyed, so 'buff up' before battle and you'll be a lot more successful.<br>
<br>
- If you have a ring that does good knockback (Bump, Shark Attack and others), then try cycling around targets, hitting one at a time (rather than focusing all attacks on one target). You'll knock your opponents back...and they often can't hit you until they get close to you again. You can keep them so off-balance that they hardly ever hit you, if you're careful.<br>
<br>
- If you have long-ranged weapons, try attacking, then moving, then attacking, then moving, etc. The more you move, the more your opponents have to move to keep track of you. If you keep them moving instead of attacking, you'll suffer less damage.<br>
<br>
- You only have eight ring slots. Thus, you'll probably always feel like you wish you could have a few more skills to really control the monster situations. You can't...but if you invite other players to a Crew, then that's the next-best thing. Your Crewmates can equip skills that you lack, and visa versa, making the Crew stronger than any of its individuals. (Plus, you get more loot when in a Crew!)<br>
<br>
- Experiment with any 'crowd control' rings you find (like Quicksand, Scaredy Cat, Duct Tape, etc.). These rings can disable monsters for a period of time, preventing them from hurting you while they're controlled, which can make a *tremendous* difference in combat situations, either solo or with a Crew.<br>
