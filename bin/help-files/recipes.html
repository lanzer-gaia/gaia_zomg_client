<h1>Recipes</h1>
Recipes are used to create new items that you can wear or place in your House.<br>
<br>
Recipes are found by defeating monsters and finishing certain quests within zOMG!.<br>
<br>
Each recipe requires a certain number of different monster loot items (items you get when you defeat monsters in combat), as well as a some gold to compensate Nicu for his efforts in helping you with the recipe exchange.<br>
<br>
Items created via recipe are not bound to your character in any way. They can be freely traded on the marketplace or given as gifts to friends.<br>
<br>
<h2>Creating Items with Recipes</h2>
To create a recipe item, go to the "Back Alley Bargains" store, run by Nicolae. You can access this store by either a) talking to Nicolae in Barton Town, or b) going to the "Shops" menu on the Gaia Online main site.<br>
<br>
Click on the "Make Recipes" button below Nicolae's image on the store page. That takes you to a page that shows all the recipes you currently own, separated into two groups: 1) Those recipes for which you've gathered all ingredients, and 2) Recipes you still need to find ingredients for before you can make them.<br>
<br>
To make a Recipe that you have all the ingredients for, just click the "Exchange" button to the right of that recipe listing.<br>
<br>
<h2>Back Alley Bargains</h2>
This store is the zOMG!-specific store on the site, run by its proprietor, Nicolae.<br>
<br>
You can easily get to this store from clicking on the "Back Alley Bargains" button on the Progress Hub widget on the screen.<br>
<br>
Within this store, you will find ways to create useable items out of monster loot and recipes.<br>
<br>
Additionally, this is the location to purchase PowerUp items for GCash. <a href="event:help:powerUps.html">Learn about PowerUps here.</a><br>
<br>
<h2>Gold and GCash</h2>
Gaia Gold is the virtual currency that you gain when you defeat monsters, complete quests, or compete in mini-games.<br>
<br>
GCash is real-world money that's been deposited on account with us so that you can access it easily while you're on the site. (This avoids hassles with credit cards and such.)<br>
<br>
You can purchase a chunk of GCash credit on our site (in the Shops area) and then use it whenever you desire. GCash cards are also sold at MANY retail sites, including Target, CVS Pharmacies, Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven and more.<br>
