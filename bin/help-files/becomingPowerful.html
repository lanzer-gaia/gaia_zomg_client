<h1>Becoming Powerful</h1>
To become more powerful, you simply pour more energy into the rings you have equipped.<br>
<br>
As you defeat monsters, complete tasks, or play various mini-games within zOMG!, you'll find "Charge Orbs".<br>
<br>
Go to the Null Chamber and "UPGRADE" your rings, adding those Charge Orbs to your rings, and the more powerful the rings become, the more powerful *YOU* become in return.<br>
<br>
In this game, "You Are What You Wear!"<br>
<br>
<h2>Upgrading Your Rings</h2>
When you enter the Null Chamber, open up your Ring inventory. On the right side of that pane, you'll see "UPGRADE" and "SALVAGE" buttons.<br>
<br>
To upgrade a ring, select the ring you want to upgrade (click on it) and then click the "UPGRADE" button. This will take orb(s) from your inventory and put them into the ring. The more powerful your ring is, the more orbs it will take to charge your ring up.<br>
<br>
Upgrading a ring increases the Charge Level ("CL") for that ring. Each Charge Level is composed of ten "steps". You fill each of those steps one at a time, until finally, you reach a new CL, hear a "ta-da!" sound, and see a congratulatory message.<br>
<br>
To salvage a ring, just select the ring and hit the "SALVAGE" button. This destroys the ring, but it will return you some of the orbs already invested into the ring so you can put them into a different ring instead.<br>
<br>
<h2>Your Character Attributes</h2>
As your rings grow in power, so do your Character Attributes.<br>
<br>
Character Attributes that are affected by the power of your rings include: Accuracy, Dodge, Willpower, Max Health, and Regeneration.<br>
<br>
These stats are directly linked to your "overall CL" value.<br>
<br>
<h3>The Character Info Pane</h3>
Your various Character Attributes are all listed on the Character Info pane. You can pull this pane up and view it by selecting yourself. This shows the Target Info box and it shows you as the selected target. You then choose the "Character Info" from the OPTIONS pull-down list.<br>
<br>
<h2>Overall Charge Level ("overall CL")</h2>
If you took all your rings and averaged their individual Charge Levels, you would get something close to your Overall CL value.<br>
<br>
However, there are a couple things that alter that calculation:<br>
<br>
- If you have a ring or two that are far in advance of the rest of your rings, then those high-CL rings will be suppressed somewhat in their power and they count less for overall CL than would be found in a straight averaging system.<br>
<br>
- If you have a couple rings that are far below the rest of your rings, then those don't affect the overall CL calculation much. This lets you experiment with low-CL rings on your character without it having much impact on your gameplay while you charge those rings up.<br>
<br>
Your Overall CL can be found on your Character Info panel, as well as on the "Progress Hub" (the widget that looks like a blue wing). On the Progress Hub, your overall CL is the number next to the ring icon.<br>
