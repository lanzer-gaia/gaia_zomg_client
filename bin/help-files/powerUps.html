<h1>PowerUps</h1>
There are items you can use to tip the odds in your favor when the chips are down and the going is tough.<br>
<br>
These items can be purchased for GCash at the 'Back Alley Bargains' store in Barton Town. They are known as 'PowerUps'.<br>
<br>
The PowerUps available at Back Alley Bargains are:<br>
<br>
<h2>Supercharger</h2>
These are sold in either 40-packs or 100-packs. Using one of these immediately replenishes your Health and Stamina by 25%. Only one charge may be used in each 15-second time period.<br>
<br>
<h2>Ghi Amp</h2>
These are sold in either 10-packs or 25-packs. This amplifies your Ghi and makes all your attacks hit a lot harder. All damage is increased by +50%. A Ghi Amp's effect lasts for twenty minutes. You won't be able to use another Ghi Amp charge until the first one's effect has expired completely.<br>
<br>
<h2>Double Orb</h2>
These are sold in either 10-packs or 25-packs and their effect lasts for twenty minutes per charge. When in effect, any loot drop containing orbs will have its quantity multiplied by two. So, in other words...you get double the regular amount of orbs.<br>
<br>
<h2>Revive</h2>
These are sold in packs of 25 charges. Whenever you are Dazed, you can use a charge to immediately Awaken (with about a third of your Health and Stamina) without having to travel to the Null Chamber.<br>
<br>
Anytime after being Awakened, you can also use Revive charges to unlock Ring Slots, two at a time, to remove the Dazed penalty locks.<br>
