<h1>Game Options</h1>
<br>
<h2>Sound</h2>
<h3>Music</h3>
This slider adjusts the volume of the music heard as you journey through the world.<br>
<h3>Sound FX</h3>
This slider adjusts the volume of the environmental sounds, monster sounds, and user interface sounds heard within the game.<br>
<br>
<h2>Controls</h2>
This area allows you to change your key-bindings within the game.
The column on the left indicates all the commands that can be bound to keyboard inputs.<br>
There are three columns next to each of those commands. Up to three different inputs can be bound to each of the different commands. However, any particular input (like the letter 'E' for example) can only be bound to ONE input at a time. So if you try to bind 'E' to more than one key, only the most recent binding will stick.<br>
When you are done making changes, just close the OPTIONS window to start using those key settings.<br>
If you have made so many changes that you're confused about the state of your bindings, just click the 'RESET KEYS TO DEFAULTS' button to restore all inputs to the default game setup...letting you start your changes again from a safe beginning spot again.<br>
<br>
<h2>Graphics Options</h2>
This tab allows you to use the standard Flash settings to voluntarily lower your resolution in order to increase your framerate.<br>
<br>
NOTE: By lowering the graphics setting, your image resolution *will* suffer. The 'low' setting, in particular, makes the font look pretty rough. But framerate should increase for you. (This feature defaults to the 'high' setting.)
