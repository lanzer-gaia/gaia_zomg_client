<h1>Movement Methods</h1>
There are two easy ways to move through the world:<br>
<br>
<h2>Left-click to Move</h2>
Just use the left mouse button to click on a location in the world and you will move there. Some areas are off limits. When an area is off-limits, your mouse cursor will change to a "circle-slash" symbol to let you know you can't click there.<br>
<br>
<h2>"WASD" or Arrow Keys</h2>
You can use keyboard input to move also.<br>
<br>
To do so, use the Arrow Keys to move, or you can use the "W", "A", "S", "D" keys the same way.<br>
<br>
<h2>Move to Target</h2>
When you have a target selected, you can move directly to that target by hitting the "G" (for "GO") key. Your avatar will move directly to the position where the target was when you hit the "G" key.<br>
