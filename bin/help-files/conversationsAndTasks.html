<h1>Conversations and Tasks</h1>
Lots of the non-player characters ("NPCs") in the world have tasks that they'd like you to accomplish.<br>
<br>
When NPCs have something to say to you, they either have a "..." bubble or a "!!!" bubble over their head.<br>
<br>
To start a conversation with an NPC, just click on either the NPC itself, or their word bubble instead.<br>
<br>
<h2>The "..." Bubble</h2>
These NPCs are just chatty. They have things of little importance to say, but you might be entertained by talking to them. They usually help flesh out the backstory in the area, or they're amusing in their own right.<br>
<br>
<h2>The "!!!" Bubble</h2>
These NPCs have a task for you. "!!!" bubbles show up in two situations: a) When the NPC has a new task to give to you, or b) when you are done with the task and the NPC wants to give you your reward for helping them out.<br>
