<h1>Rage Ranks</h1>
As was explained in training, the emotional energy that you generate when under stress will slowly accumulate within you while you fight. This energy (commonly called 'Rage') can be funneled through your ring when activating it to create spectacular and powerful bonus effects.<br>
<br>
Every ring has four Rage Ranks. When you attack a target with a single click of the mouse or hotkey, that ring is activating at Rage Rank 1.<br>
<br>
However, if you hold down the mouse button or hotkey, and don't release it immediately, you'll see your Rage Meter (on the Action Bar) start to fill up from left to right. The Rage Meter is divided into three areas and each area must be completely filled to release it at the next Rage Rank up.<br>
<br>
In other words, if I click and hold the mouse button, and wait until the first third of the Rage Meter is full up before releasing the button, I will fire the effect at Rage Rank 2 (RR2). If I fill up the next section before releasing, I'll fire at Rage Rank 3 instead. And if I don't release until the Rage Meter is completely full up (all three sections filled), then I'll be firing at Rage Rank 4.<br>
<br>
Rage is accumulated by using your Rings and by being damaged by enemies. You cannot charge your Rage Meter up beyond the Rage that you've collected so far, so you need to use your Rings or get into harm's way to gain more Rage before you can fire off the really cool RR4 effects.<br>
<br>
<h2>Rage Rank Tips</h2>
There are a few things to remember about Rage Ranks:<br>
<br>
- Higher rage rank effects do NOT consume additional Stamina. So you can get a lot more 'bang for the buck' with your Stamina if you fire off high-Rage Rank attacks or buffs from time-to-time.<br>
<br>
- Each additional Rage Rank does substantially more boost to the base effect of the ring than the Rage Rank before it. So even though RR4 takes more effort to get off during combat, it's absolutely worth the extra time it takes.<br>
