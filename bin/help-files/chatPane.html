<h1>The Chat Pane</h1>
The chat pane is a great way to stay in touch with the people around you in the game.<br>
If you look at the chat pane, you'll see several major features:<br>
<br>
<h2>Text entry field</h2>
This field is where you enter text. You don't have to click on this field to activate it (although that *does* work). While playing the game, you can just hit ENTER to move the focus to the chat text entry field. Then you can type what you want to say and hit ENTER to send it. The focus will then shift back to the game window and you can keep playing.<br>
<br>
<h2>Channel Tabs</h2>
The tabs across the top of the pane are the various types of chat that you can receive. The "ALL" tab has all the chat types collected together, but clicking on one of the other tabs lets you see *just* the information described. For example, if you *only* want to see what's sent to you in the /crew channel, then click the CREW tab and that's all you'll see. (Click the ALL tab to go back to listening to everything again.)<br>
<br>
<h2>Send Buttons</h2>
Below the area that shows the chat you've received, but above the text entry field, you'll see four colored tabs. Those tabs let you pick a default channel on which to *send* text to other people.<br>
<br>
<h2>Sending</h2>
The four "send" buttons are (from left to right):<br>
<h3>white : Talk</h3>
key shortcut : /t<br>
This sends chat messages to people in the immediate room around you.<br>
<h3>red : Shout</h3>
key shortcut : /s<br>
This sends chat to everyone in the same zone as you and is commonly used to ask questions, auction items, etc. Warning: Too much liberal use of this channel may cause other folks to yell at you for "spamming" so use it sparingly. :)<br>
<h3>blue : Crew</h3>
key shortcut : /c<br>
Any text entered is sent to only those players in your Crew. This is very useful for chatting during combat. Crew messages are sent to crew members regardless of their location within the game.<br>
<h3>orange : Clan</h3>
key shortcut : /cl<br>
Text entered on this channel goes out to everyone in your Clan, regardless of their location within the game.<br>
<br>
<h2>Whispers</h2>
There's one other way to send messages in the game. It's called a "whisper". This is used to send a message to a specific player, and such a message can be sent to any player in the game, regardless of location. The feature uses Gaia Instant Messenger, which is entered automatically as you launch zOMG!.<br>
A /whisper has to reference a player's name, so it's a little trickier to use than the standard chat channels.<br>
<br>
Type "/w <playerName> <messageYouWantToSend>" to send a whisper.<br>
For example, if I was going to send a whisper to Qixter, I would type the following:<br>
	/w Qixter Hi there!<br>
and then hit ENTER to send it.<br>
<br>
NOTE: If you are sending a /whisper to someone that has spaces in their name (example: "The Undead Suitor") then you would need to use underscore characters instead of spaces. (example: "The_Undead_Suitor")<br>
<br>
For ease of usage, you can respond to a /whisper by just hitting BACKSPACE instead of typing all that "/w" stuff out again.<br>
<br>
You can also use "/r" to reply, if you'd prefer. An example would be:<br>
	/r Hi there!<br>
to return a message to the person that just sent you a whisper. (/r is useful if you prefer to bind BACKSPACE to a different key than to respond to a whisper.)<br>
<br>
Another way to easily send a whisper is to select another player's avatar, and then choose "Whisper" command from the menu in his Target Info window.<br>
<br>
<h2>Advanced Bonus Feature!!</h2>
You can use a whisper just like the regular GIM feature on the site. That means you can communicate with anyone *outside the game* that you can normally reach via the GIM feature on the main site.<br>
<br>
The format is the same as a normal whisper, but if you're addressing to someone not using a Gaia username, you'll need to use the extender on their name (example: playerName@aol.com).<br>
