<h1>Monster "Conning" and Loot Chances</h1>
<br>
<h2>How Tough Is That Monster? ('Conning')</h2>
So, you're wandering through the areas around Barton Town. Sometimes you find easy monsters, and sometimes you find extremely tough monsters. Is there any way for you to tell how tough a monster is before stepping up to it and getting whacked?<br>
<br>
There sure is. This is typically called 'conning' (which is short for 'considering the monster'), which is a method of letting you take a look at a monster and determining how tough it is in relation to your current capabilities.<br>
<br>
In zOMG!, the way we show you this is through the Target Info window. Whenever you select a target, its image, name, and health bar are shown in this window. The name and image background of that monster and is color-coded to let you see that comparative strength.<br>
<br>
The colors are in the same order of a prism/rainbow, to make it easier to remember them:<br>
Purple = no challenge<br>
Blue = you'll usually win...typically only really dangerous when attacking in groups<br>
Green = about your strength...a one-on-one battle should be pretty fair odds<br>
Yellow = tougher than you...a friend or two to help you wouldn't hurt<br>
Red = extremely challenging<br>
<br>
<h2>Monster Loot and Conning</h2>
In a nutshell, you get the best chances for loot when defeating a monster if that monster is a reasonable challenge for you.<br>
<br>
If the monster is too easy, you get nothing. If the monster is too tough, then you also get nothing. But when the monster is just right...ah...the loot shall flow!<br>
<br>
Purple = No loot<br>
Blue = These monsters are easy for you. Loot chances are halved.<br>
Green = Max loot chance<br>
Yellow = Max loot chance<br>
Red = No loot<br>
<br>
