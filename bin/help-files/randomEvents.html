<h1>Random Mini-Events</h1>
<br>
<h2>AirShark Bombardment</h2>
<h3>Barton Town ( CL 2.0 or less )</h3>
Summary: AirShark descends from the clouds, roaming around Barton Town and dropping Sky Bombs on unsuspecting townspeople and adventurers!<br>
<br>
<h3>Rules</h3>
- The Sky Bombs damage anyone near them when they detonate, and sometimes explode out into Sky Boxes...which attack any nearby targets of opportunity.<br>
- The event lasts 20 minutes or until Gaians rally together and destroy 200 Sky Boxes, whichever comes first.<br>
<br>
<h3>Goal & Rewards</h3>
Keep Barton Town safe by defeating the Sky Boxes that appear. Rewards at the end of the event are based on how many Sky Boxes you've fought that are defeated during the event. (Fighting doesn't necessarily mean "killing". You can earn rewards by healing other players, using Crowd Control, etc.)<br>
The size of rewards is halved if 200 Sky Boxes are not defeated before the time expires.<br>

- There are three "lawnsharks".<br>
- The scenario lasts for 20 minutes, or until all three lawnsharks are destroyed, whichever comes first.<br>
<br>
<h3>Goal & Rewards</h3>
Defeat all three of the lawnsharks. Rewards are based on how much you've done during the fights, whether through damage, healing of allies, crowd control, etc.<br>

<h2>Grucken Chuckin'</h2>
<h3>Bill's Ranch ( No CL Limit )</h3>
Summary: Someone has fed G-Virus to the chickens in Bill's Ranch. They've mutated into the green monstrosities known as Gruckens and now Bill's family needs you to help get rid of them!<br>
<br>
<h3>Rules</h3>
- Gruckens spawn fairly often at random anywhere on Rancher Bill's fields while this event runs. (They don't spawn elsewhere in the zone).<br>
- There is a maximum to the number of Gruckens that spawn, so the only reliable way to make more appear is to throw some of the existing ones down the well.<br>
- The event runs for 20 minutes.<br>
<br>
<h3>Goal & Rewards</h3>
Grab a Grucken (easier said than done), take it to the well and drop it in, doing this as many times during the event as possible. At the end, you are rewarded for the number of Gruckens you drop in the well.<br>
Badges: Stop That Grucken Around & That's Grucken Amazing!<br>
Recipe Component: Grucken Feather.<br>

<h2>Deadman Spies</h2>
<h3>Zen Gardens ( CL 4.0 or less )</h3>
Summary: The folks living in the House on the Hill above Deadman's Pass are sending scouts down to find out more about the Zen Gardens area. Why? Only time will tell! But Katsumi wants you to stop the spies from returning back with whatever information they are seeking!<br>
<br>
<h3>Rules</h3>
- The area is being invaded by Clutch patrols. These patrols seem to be most interested in particular "landmark" areas of the Gardens and are doing sweeps of those various locations.<br>
- There is a finite number of patrols coming into the area. This event runs until all of those patrols have either been destroyed or they have completed their sweeps of the area.<br>
<br>
<h3>Goal & Rewards</h3>
Defeat these patrols before they complete their patrols, preventing them from returning to Deadman's Pass. You are rewarded at the end of the event based on how many Clutches you stop. This reward is modified by how many of the patrols were stopped by everyone in the area, so you'll get the biggest rewards when everyone works together to stop this menace!<br>

<h2>BuzzKill</h2>
<h3>Bass'ken Lake ( CL 5.0 or less )</h3>
Summary: The Buzz Saws have pooled lifeforce to spawn a giant monstrosity known as BuzzKill! Now it terrorizes the Bass'ken Lake area!<br>
<br>
<h3>Rules</h3>
- BuzzKill can fold space, moving easily from location to location, warping wherever it wishes.<br>
- When hurt too much at once, BuzzKill tends to warp away from the fray, looking for easier pickings.<br>
<br>
<h3>Goal & Rewards</h3>
Defeat BuzzKill! You are rewarded based on how much you did in the fight (either through damage, healing of allies, crowd control options, etc.)<br>
Badges: Beat the Buzzer & Buzzkiller.<br>
Recipe Component: Loose Screw.<br>

<h2>Bug Breakout</h2>
<h3>Old Aqueduct ( CL 6.0 or less )</h3>
Summary: The aliens from across the stars are tired of Gaians coming through the Star Portal to torment them in their Hive. Now they're trying to break out and make a foothold in the Old Aqueduct itself!<br>
<br>
<h3>Rules</h3>
- To clear the area when the aliens come through the Star Portal, they first send through a wave of Deathroaches.<br>
- Deathroaches are powerful creatures that will try and touch a specific person, detonating in a biowave of energy, decimating their chosen target. So destroy it at range, run away from it to a safe range, or do anything you can...just don't let it touch you!<br>
- The Deathroach wave is followed quickly by a huge outpouring of Shockroaches, Walkers, Lightning Bugs, and/or Landstriders. These bugs will comb through the area, destroying anything they can find.<br>
- Occasionally, the Hive calls its bugs back for repair and rest. The bugs then head back to the Star Portal to recuperate in the Hive for a bit before coming back for more.<br>
- The event lasts for 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
<h3>Goal & Rewards</h3>
Destroy as many bugs as you can during the attempted breakout. You are rewarded based on how much you do in the fights during that time. (Damage, healing of allies, crowd control usage, etc.)<br>
Badges: Bug Stomper & Insecticide<br>

<h2>P3 Trophy Hunting</h2>
<h3>Gold Beach ( CL 7.0 or less )</h3>
Summary: The Predator Prairie Pups (P3s) have left the Aqueduct to go on a hunt for trophies. They must be driven back into the Aqueduct without their trophies or they'll soon expand out into the rest of Gaia!<br>
<br>
<h3>Rules</h3>
- This event is similar in nature to "Deadman Spies" in that the P3s have formed patrols to scout through the Beach, looking for trophies. However, they are hostile to pretty much everything in the area, and you'll see them fighting all kinds of foes as they seek their trophies.<br>
- The event lasts 20 minutes.<br>
<br>
<h3>Goal & Rewards</h3>
Defeat all 100 P3s in 20 minutes or less or the event fails for everyone. If all 100 are defeated, then your reward is based upon how many P3s you fought during the event.<br>
Badges: Hunt Harasser & P3TA<br>

<h2>Saving the Spirits</h2>
<h3>Otami Ruins ( CL 8.0 or less )</h3>
Summary: The Tiny Terrors have found a way to drain the lifeforce directly from the Otami Spirits themselves! What are they using that lifeforce for? Only time will tell!<br>
<br>
<h3>Rules</h3>
- There are four Spirit Pyres in the Otami Ruins area.<br>
- The Tiny Terrors and their Feathered Coatl allies will try to keep those Pyres lit. While the Pyres are lit, the Otami Spirits are being drained.<br>
- You and your friends need to douse those Pyres and keep them snuffed out.<br>
- Three players must get together, close to a Pyre, to begin the process of snuffing it out. Once you start the quenching process, keep the area free of monsters while until the timer expires and the flame will go out. If the timer expires with too many monsters in the area, or if less than three players are still fighting in that area when the time expires, then the flame will continue to burn.<br>
- Once players manage to douse a Spirit Pyre, the monsters will start coming back to it, trying to get it lit again. If too many of them get near the Spirit Pyre, a new timer will be stared, and if too many monsters are still in the area when that timer expires, the Pyre will relight!<br>
- The event lasts 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
<h3>Goal & Rewards</h3>
Quench all four Spirit Pyres and keep them quenched for the duration of the event. Your rewards are based exclusively on how long the four pyres are quenched during the events. The longer the pyres are quenched, the greater the rewards. (You still must meet a certain threshold of activity within the event to qualify for a reward, however.)<br>

<h2>Orb Spills</h2>
<h3>All Zones (CL limit appropriate to Zone)</h3>
Summary: Ghi force (lifeforce) has built up to an extreme level in this area and has spilled out spontaneously in the form of Charge Orbs, appearing under bushes, behind trees, underwater, and everywhere!<br>
<br>
<h3>Rules</h3>
- Damage the Charge Orbs with any of your ring powers. It will then *pop* and Charge Orbs will spill out to be absorbed into you.<br>
- Charge Orbs are "first come, first serve". Part of the game is to get to them before someone else does.<br>
- Orb Spills last 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
<h3>Goal & Rewards</h3>
Pop as many of the Charge Orbs as you can during the event. Orb rewards are greater in higher-CL zones, largest in Otami Ruins, and smallest in Barton Town and the Village Greens.<br>
