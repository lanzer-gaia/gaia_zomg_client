<h1>Changing Zones</h1>
There are two ways your avatar gets moved from one zone to another. Those methods are:<br>
<br>
<h2>Switch</h2>
When your mouse cursor has changed to a "Gears" symbol, you are hovering over a usable object (what we call a "switch"). Many times, a switch can be used as a door or portal of some sort. Clicking that switch may move your character to another area. Many times, you won't know what the switch does until you try it!<br>
<br>
<h2>Trigger Zone</h2>
Trigger zones are invisible, so there's no way for you to know ahead of time when you are about to step into one, but they are often used in logical places...and for ambushes. A good example of such a trigger zone is the Star Portal in the Old Aqueduct, which you don't have to activate...but it must recognize that you've done something special before it will open for you.<br>
<br>
<h1>Changing Rooms</h1>
There are two ways to move from the Room you're in currently to one that is directly next to it.<br>
<br>
<h2>The "Gold Arrow"</h2>
By moving your mouse to the edge of your game screen, it will check to see if you can move across to the next room at that spot. If the check is legal, then your mouse cursor changes to a "Gold Arrow". Click when the cursor is the Arrow and your avatar moves to the game window edge and then into the next room.<br>
<br>
<h2>Keyboard Movement</h2>
You can also use keyboard movement to just "push" into the next room. If there is empty space in the next room at the location you are pushing, then your avatar will slide into the next Room. If there isn't space available, then you'll be blocked and need to try another location instead.<br>
