<h1>Health and Stamina</h1>
Your current Health and Stamina are boosted directly by your overall CL. In other words, the more power that is in the rings you're wearing, the tougher your avatar becomes.<br>
<br>
<h2>Health (Dazed and Awakened)</h2>
If your health goes to zero, then you become "Dazed".<br>
<br>
You can only become un-Dazed by:<br
<br>
- Releasing to the Null Chamber (by clicking the "Awaken Now" button when it appears). This brings you back to the chamber with Trixie. You can rest here. It's safe. When you're ready to leave, just click one of the exit crystals that you have attuned and you'll go to that zone.<br>
<br>
- Having another player Awaken you. Currently, the only way for another player to Awaken you is by using the "Defibrillate" ring. The more Rage the player uses on that ring, the more ring slots will be unlocked when you are Awakened.<br>
<br>
<h2>Recovering Health</h2>
Once you lose Health, it won't come back unless you do one of the following:<br>
<br>
- Standing : You slowly regain Health when out of combat. You are out of combat when no monster has attacked you and you have used no attack rings for a short period of time. <br>
<br>
- Kneeling : You can increase the amount regained by kneeling. Be wary though! If you are attacked while kneeling, you take three-times normal damage! <br>
<br>
- Healing Rings : Many rings (like Bandage, Diagnose, Wish, etc.) will restore health directly to at least one target at a time.<br>
<br>
- Boosting Health Regen : Rings like Healing Halo, or some Ring Set Bonuses (like "Medic") will increase your Regeneration stat, which greatly boosts your healing speed.<br>
<br>
- Supercharger (PowerUp) : The Supercharger PowerUp both heals you *and* refreshes your Stamina at the same time! Go see Nicolae at Back Alley Bargains for more details. These are *extremely* useful in combat.<br>
<br>
<h2>Stamina</h2>
When you run out of Stamina, you become exhausted and you can't use your rings anymore until you recover a bit.<br>
<br>
Each of your rings costs a certain amount of Stamina to use. You must have at least that much Stamina to be able to fire the ring.<br>
<br>
You can recover Stamina in any of the following ways:<br>
<br>
- Standing : You recover Stamina very slowly while standing and moving around.<br>
<br>
- Kneeling : When you kneel, your stamina regeneration rate kicks into a higher gear and you start recovering Stamina faster than when moving around or standing.<br>
<br>
- Boosting Stamina Regen : Rings like Divinity, or some Ring Set Bonuses (like "Demon" ) will increase your Stamina Regeneration stat, which greatly boosts the rate your recover Stamina.<br>
<br>
- Supercharger (PowerUp) : The Supercharger PowerUp both refreshes your Stamina *and* heals you at the same time! Go see Nicolae at Back Alley Bargains for more details. These are *extremely* useful in combat.<br>
