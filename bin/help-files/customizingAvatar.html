<h1>Customizing Avatar</h1>
<br>
<h2>How to Customize</h2>
It's easy to customize your avatar to look different. You can equip any of the recipe items you make, as well as any of the items you buy in the Gaia stores.<br>
<br>
To open the customization window from within zOMG!, follow these steps:<br>
   - Target yourself.
   - Click the menu drop-down on the Target widget and select "Character Info".<br>
   - Then click the "Customize Avatar" button on the Character Info pane.<br>
<br>
This opens up the "Customize Avatar" window from the main site. This shows you all the inventory you have, whether you got it within zOMG! or not. You can equip anything you see by clicking it once to equip it, and once again to de-equip it.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Once you save your avatar, your character will be updated to look that way the next time that you log into zOMG!. (The game will not currently refresh your outfit until after you log out and in again.)<br>
