<h1>World Areas</h1>
There are many widely varied areas to explore within the world. The list below is only *some* of the places that you can find when adventuring in the world of Gaia.<br><br>
<h2>The Waterworks</h2>
<h3>CL : 1.0</h3>
The canals and tunnels below Barton Town were created many years ago by mad artisans that spent great care creating grillworks and carvings that would be seen by very few people.<br>
<br>
<h2>Barton Town</h2>
<h3>CL : Any</h3>
The oldest of the towns in the area, Barton Town has managed to stay pastoral and quaint throughout the years.<br>
<br>
<h2>Village Greens</h2>
<h3>CL : 1.0 - 2.0</h3>
Rolling green hills and a small "goof" course separate the main Barton Town from its suburban-like housing areas.<br>
<br>
<h2>Bill's Ranch</h2>
<h3>CL : 1.8 - 3.0</h3>
Rancher Bill has raised cows and chickens here for years. It's only been since the recent vampire uprisings that he also started planting garlic.<br>
<br>
<h2>Deadman's Pass</h2>
<h3>CL : 2.2 - 2.8</h3>
There's a house at the top of this hill, but even though the lights are often on there, no one is ever seen coming or going. Plus, the presence of the Von Helson family plot at the base of the hill keeps most curiosity seekers at bay.<br>
<br>
<h2>Zen Gardens</h2>
<h3>CL : 3.0 - 4.0</h3>
Cultivated carefully by a family working for the Chyaku Noirosu clan, these beautiful gardens have become a tourist destination for those traveling here from Durem or Aekea.<br>
<br>
<h2>Bass'ken Lake</h2>
<h3>CL : 4.0 - 5.0</h3>
A great fishing lake lies square in the middle of a mostly abandoned lumber camp that thrived back in the times before the Durem Reclamation Center outmoded the old Aqueduct that ran to this lake. The lake is a quiet backwater now, but is still home to the Ole Fishing Hole general store.<br>
<br>
<h2>Buccaneer Boardwalk</h2>
<h3>CL : 5.0 - 6.0</h3>
The Pirates of the Shallow Sea are starting a supposedly legitimate business venture here at the old Gambino docks, renovating the area into an amusement boardwalk. The ferry running from here to Gambino Island has been shut down during the construction.<br>
<br>
<h2>Old Aqueduct</h2>
<h3>CL : 5.0 - 6.0</h3>
This area where pine forest meets jungle is also home to two other major features: the derelict Aqueduct that is now in ruins after being replaced by the Durem Reclamation Facility, and the abandoned Star Portal left here by the Zurg armada when they left Gaia and returned to space.<br>
<br>
<h2>Gold Beach</h2>
<h3>CL : 6.0 - 7.0</h3>
A wide sandy beach is sheltered by coral outcroppings far out to sea. A lighthouse warns passing ships to stay far away to avoid the dangers of these shallows.<br>
<br>
<h2>Otami Ruins</h2>
<h3>CL : 7.0 - 8.0</h3>
Long ago, a mighty civilization became so warlike that they eventually ran out of enemies and fell upon themselves. The resulting savagery was so great that some believe the Otami were all destroyed. However, they left behind magnificent temples and ruins throughout the jungles to the northwest.<br>
<br>
<h2>Beyond Otami (???)</h2>
<h3>CL : 8.0+</h3>
There areas beyond the Otami Ruins which are only revealed to you after you finish the Otami tasks.<br>
