<h1>Recrewting</h1>
(First things first: Yes, we know that "Recruit" is misspelled. It's a pun. You're forming a Crew. Get it?)<br>
<br>
<h2>Why Form a Crew?</h2>
The short list of answer is:<br>
<br>
- More loot : If a monster drops a certain amount of gold, that gold is not divided up between Crew members. Instead, that same amount of gold is given to EVERY crew member when the monster is defeated. Since Crews can defeat lots of monsters in the same amount of time that a solo player could do it, this results in Crews raking in a lot more gold than solo players.<br>
<br>
- Better tactical coverage of useful rings : Because you can only carry eight rings at a time, there will always be useful rings that you *could* have brought along, but didn't. A well organized Crew can ensure that all the really useful rings are brought along.<br>
<br>
- More fun : When you come right down to it, you're playing an MMO because you want to be around other players. Getting together into a Crew with other players is a good way of meeting folks and sharing the fun.<br>
<br>
<h2>The Crew Pane</h2>
To pull up your Crew pane, click the "Crew Pane" button on the left end of the Action Bar at the bottom of your game window.<br>
<br>
This pane shows a list of everyone in your Crew, as well as Health and Stamina bars for each of them also.<br>
<br>
To the right of each crewmate name, you'll see a row of "buff" icons. These icons show you, at a glance, what status effects are being applied to your crewmates.<br>
<br>
The icons along the bottom of the Crew pane allow you to leave the crew, open up the Recrewt list, or (if you are the crew's leader) allow you to promote other players to become the Crew leader or kick a crewmate out of the Crew entirely.<br>
<br>
<h2>The RECREWT pane (Finding a Crew!)</h2>
The Recrewt pane is a way for you to find other players to invite into your Crew. It can be accessed in two different ways: Either from the RECREWT button on the PDA, or the "handshake" icon on your Crew pane.<br>
<br>
Click one of those buttons and pull up the RECREWT panel. Then read the rest of this and you'll see how easy it is to use.<br>
<br>
<h3>User Names</h3>
This is the list of all players currently looking to join a crew. It is listed in alphabetical order. You can reverse the order by clicking the "User Name" header on that column.<br>
<br>
<h3>TC (Total Charge)</h3>
This column shows you the Total Charge values for all the listed players. Total Charge is the amount of orbs that each of those players have collected in-game, so it's a good measure of a player's veteran status. The more orbs that they've collected, the more that they've played the game.<br>
<br>
<h3>Equipped Rings</h3>
Sometimes you'll want to look for someone that has specific rings to add to your Crew. The rings currently equipped by each player are listed next to their name so you can see that information at-a-glance.<br>
<br>
<h3>Con</h3>
This is the relative "con" level (short for "CONsidering the monster") between YOU and the player you're seeing on the Recrewt List. If you're looking for players at about the same Overall Charge Level as yourself, then look for green names.<br>
<br>
<h2>Con Filters</h2>
It's not always useful to see players that are far above, or far below, your current CL level. If you want to see a shorter list, you can toggle on/off the various conning levels by clicking the color buttons at the top of the RECREWT list.<br>
<br>
For example, if you only want to see players that are about your same Overall CL, then unclick the purple, blue, gold, and red buttons (leaving only the green one highlighted) and you'll ONLY see players that are around the same rating as you.<br>
<br>
<h2>Looking for Crew</h2>
You may not always be in the market to join a Crew. If that's the case, then unclick the "Looking for Crew" checkbox at the bottom of the RECREWT panel, and you will no longer show up on the RECREWT lists for other players.<br>
<br>
If you later decide to join a Crew, just turn that checkbox back on and you'll start being visible to other players again.<br>
