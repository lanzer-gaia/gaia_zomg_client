<h1>Mini-Games</h1>
There are currently three repeatable mini-games within zOMG! and are all described below.<br>
<br>
<h2>The Fountain Game</h2>
In the center of Barton Town, there is a four-person game that can be played to gain gold and orbs. The objective is to watch the lights and sounds and then get your crew to repeat that pattern by stepping on the colored lights around the fountain.<br>
<br>
To start the game, click the signpost in the lower, right corner of that room. This brings up instructions for the game, and puts you into queue for the game if other crews are already signed up for it.<br>
<br>
<h2>The Goof Course</h2>
In Village Greens, you'll find a "Goof" tee next to an NPC named MacTaggert.<br>
<br>
MacTaggert can teach you how to play the game, but the game itself is like a cross between golf and billiards, where you try to complete the nine-hole course with the fewest strokes possible. The game is played in the same area where other players are fighting monsters in the Village Greens.<br>
<br>
<h2>The Hive</h2>
This repeatable game is only available after you finish the tasks for Agent Caruthers in the Old Aqueduct area, but once it is unlocked, you can warp through the Star Portal to play a "Last Man Standing" kind of game. The main objective is to stay alive for as long as you can.<br>
