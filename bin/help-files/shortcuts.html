<h1>Key Shortcuts</h1>
<br>
<h2>Setting up Your Own Keys Bindings</h2>
Before explaining the default keys, we should mention that ALL of these key-bindings are editable.<br>
   - Go to MENU.<br>
   - Pull up OPTIONS<br>
   - Go to the CONTROLS tab<br>
   - Click on any key-binding to select it and then click a new key to assign it to that function.<br>
<br>
<h2>Default Keys</h2>
<h3>Movement</h3>
Left-mouse *and* WASD *and* the arrow keys. You can use any or all of those to move.<br>
<br>
<h3>Equipped Rings</h3>
1-8 (from left-most ring to right-most)<br>
<br>
<h3>Target Next Available Enemy</h3>
Q and ~ (NOTE: For "~" you don't actually have to hit SHIFT to type the key. It's actually the "`" key, but that doesn't show up well, so we call it the "~" key)<br>
<br>
<h3>Target Next Crew Member</h3>
These keys are not currently assigned. If you wish to use them during beta, open OPTIONS and go to the CONTROLS tab to edit them manually. They should work.<br>
NOTE: You can also click on the names of your crew members in the Crew pane to select them via mouse. (This is an easier way to select an ally that is in the middle of a large group of monsters and is more reliable in low-framerate situations also.)<br>
<br>
<h3>PowerUp Hot Tray</h3>
While not actually a "shortcut", it bears mentioning that you can open your PowerUps tray by  clicking the small red up arrow to the left of your Ring Tray (on the Action Bar). This tray allows you quick access to PowerUps and makes them easy-to-use in combat situations.<br>
<br>
<h2>Flash Reserved Keys</h2>
There are some useful keys that we'd like to let you use in the game, but they're reserved by Flash, so we just have to avoid using them.<br>
<br>
Those keys are:<br>
   - TAB<br>
   - F1<br>
   - ESC<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
