<h1>Suggested System Specifications</h1>
<br>
<h2>Poor Performance</h2>
<p><img src='help-files/topic-content/default/performanceIcon.png'></p><textformat leading='6'> </textformat><br>
This icon is displayed in the game title bar when experiencing poor performance. If you see this icon for extended periods, please be sure to close all other browser windows and/or tabs, other programs you may be running, and be sure your computer meets the Specifications described below.<br>
<br>
<h2>CPU</h2>
CPU has an impact on AI decisions and how quickly an object can be 'rasterized' after it is downloaded. Those activities take place on your local system, and CPU helps reduce the overhead of those actions.<br>
<br>
You need at least a single-CPU of 1.8Ghz in speed or greater. Dual- and quad-core machines will get a boost during the rasterization process, but won't see more than a 10% bump otherwise because Flash does not currently take advantage of multiple processors in a system.<br>
<br>
<h2>System RAM</h2>
It's a big world, and everything in it takes up System RAM. The more you have, the fewer times your system will have to dump old information and load up new stuff. It's the dumping and loading process that hammers your game performance, so the more, the merrier on System RAM.<br>
<br>
The minimum amount of System RAM necessary to play zOMG! is 512MB. Anything from 1024 and beyond will run the game well, and beyond 1024 isn't really necessary.<br>
<br>
(NOTE: Celeron machines benchmark significantly slower than their Ghz rating, so keep that in mind if you have one.)<br>
<br>
<h2>Web Browser</h2>
Surprisingly, your web browser choice makes a huge difference in the quality of your gameplay.<br>
<br>
Why? It has to do with the dumping and loading of memory again. Certain browsers (like Internet Explorer) have a very low tolerance for memory allocated to an app running on their browser. So they force "garbage collection" to occur frequently, and that causes lots of nasty spikes while you play.<br>
<br>
The browser with the best performance currently is Firefox, followed by Safari and Chrome, and then distantly followed by Internet Explorer.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Vivox (our VOIP provider) does not currently support either Safari or Chrome for using the Voice Over Internet Provider so you can talk on the microphone to your Crew, so Firefox is your best choice if you like that feature.<br>
<br>
<h2>Video and Sound Cards</h2>
Video and Sound cards have no bearing whatsoever on the performance of zOMG!. Flash does not allow access to those devices...yet.<br>
<br>
<h2>Connection Speed</h2>
Whenever you do anything in the game, your system sends a message to the servers, the servers think about it a bit, and then send back an answer. Your connection speed directly impacts how much traffic can go back and forth. If you can't pass enough information easily, then you get "rubberbanding" or "lag spikes".<br>
<br>
zOMG! does not support dial-up modems of any kind. (56K or slower connections can't push enough data.)<br>
<br>
You need a connection of at least DSL speeds to play zOMG!.<br>
<br>
<h2>Minimum Specifications</h2>
This is the minimum configuration needed to run zOMG!. You may need to turn some settings down or off, but you can still play well.<br>
Single CPU : 1.8 Ghz<br>
System RAM : 512 MB<br>
Web Browser : Internet Explorer<br>
Connection Speed : DSL<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Suggested Specifications</h2>
This is a configuration that allows you to play zOMG! with the minimum of hitches or disruptions. Play should be smooth.<br>
Single CPU : 2.4 Ghz or greater, dual- or quad-core is helpful<br>
System RAM : 1024 or greater<br>
Web Browser : Firefox<br>
Connection Speed : Cable<br>
<br>
