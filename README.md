# gaia_zomg_client
Gaia's MMO zOMG client written in Adobe Flash AS3

This client was compiled with Adobe Flash Builder 4.5.  If you have Flash Builder installed you can head over to fla/battleClientSharedBuild/ and find scripts to build the core client.  Note that there are various components such as its Flexmodules and others in the list below.  They will need to be compiled for the client to run.  Then of course all the assets for rings, monsters, sounds, emotes and maps will need to be present.  All those are publically available on https://graphics.gaiaonline.com/images/Gaia_Flash/zomg/S60435 whcih is our latest build.
